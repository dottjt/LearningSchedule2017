Let me start by saying that Reactjs and Redux are awful to work with. Completely sane, though awful. Javascript is a terrible functional language to work with, and barely assists in the writing of good FRP code. HOWEVER, it's what we're stuck with and it's probably the least evil option.

Versions 

LS2017 V0 - Base project
LS2017 V1 - React + Redux connected 
LS2017 V2 (current) - Connecting application to backend

Built using a number of libraries:

- React
- Redux
- Redux-Form
- React-Router
- React-Tags-Input
- Uuid
- Express

Will update as the application progresses. Hopefully it should be a real winner!
